## Starting up Snakemake

Basic steps to getting snakemake running.


### Acquire Cluster Resources

First it's best to start and run things in a screen/tmux session.

```{bash}

screen -S name_of_socket


```

Next we need to request resources from the cluster:

```{bash}

srun -p high -t 300:00:00 --mem=10G --pty bash

```

### Running Things on the cluster

```{bash}

snakemake --cores 1 -n -p -s snakefile

```

`-s` specifies the Snakefile
`-n` specifies a dry run
`-p` says print out what the hell happens
`-f` force all rules to run
`-R` use with a rule name after to run a single rule or up/thru just that rule

### Demultiplexing Snakefile

```{bash}

# paste in from cluster here


```
